# React Peg &middot; [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mistlog/react-peg.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mistlog/react-peg) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/mistlog/react-peg/badge.svg)](https://coveralls.io/github/mistlog/react-peg)

React Peg is a react style parser generator based on PEG.js.

* Type Checking: With typescript & jsx support, you don't need to play with grammar as string any more.

* Rule-Based: Build encapsulated rules and compose them to make complex grammar, and you can reuse them just like UI components.

* Easy to Debug & Unit Test: Since rule is written in JavaScript instead of string, you can easily debug & test grammar and parser.
